Mozzarilla is a file editing program, and is intended to be a complete replacement for Halo Custom Edition's Guerilla, with additional tools and ease of use upgrades, including:

* Edits regular [tags][h1/tags], [OpenSauce][] tags, and gametypes
* Loads corrupt tags and view/edit hidden data
* Export/imports [blocks][h1/tags#blocks]
* Edits tags safely with backups and undo functionality
* Contains a hierarchy view for easily browsing a tags directory
* Switches between multiple tag directories
* Scans for broken tag dependencies and displays tag dependencies
* Displays, validates, and archives tag dependencies


Mozzerilla should not be used with the HEK for MCC PC, as some tags are not able to then be loaded in the H1 tags build or though H1 MCC tool. While some tags may appear to work correctly, it is best to assume there can be problems and it is highly advised to keep a backup just in case.

Appears to work
-Gearbox Model

Will cause exceptions
